This is an open letter to landlords.  Please define the term "pet" in your "No pets allowed" policy. 

I've recently been looking for a new house to rent. This has been a major ordeal. Let's skip past the hassle of finding legitimate homes, making contact, and getting past a plethora of various policies to just get to look at a place and just focus on "Pet Policy"

## No Pets Allowed

I do not have a dog or a cat. I have a bearded dragon. This is a caged pet.  I consider her a pet so when I see "No Pets Allowed" I assume this includes her.

But what does "No Pets Allowed" mean to landlords?  It depends. Some literally do mean absolutely no animals other than the humans that are specifically named on the lease. Others it means no cats or dogs but caged animals, including fish, are fine. Others it means no cats, dogs, fish, or reptiles but if you want to have a hampster that's fine.  On top of that some only allow cats or dogs and not other caged animals. 

That's helpful. So helpful. I mean knowing this now I can just ignore "No Pets Allowed" and contact the landlord, right?

No! I tried that earlier this week. Very first landlord I contacted gave me a lot of details about the house. It sounded nice and I set up an appointment to look at it. My final question before hanging up the phone was. "Does your no pets allowed policy include caged animals?"  The response, and I'll clean it up a bit, was no. Actually his response was rather mean and unpleasant. I even tried to explain to him that every landlord defines pets differently and that's why I asked.  Needless to say I canceled the appointment.  I don't think I'd want to deal with anyone who is that unpleasant when I'm trying to do business with them.

Now what? I mean I could contact 10 more landlords and have the same results.  I decided to do an experiment.  I contacted 20 landlords. I asked about their pet policy.  Here are the results.

### No Pets Allowed

There were 9 who had posted "No Pets Allowed" and this is what that actually mens to them.

* 2 meant absolutely no pets of any kind.
* 6 meant no dogs or cats but caged animals are considered on a case by case basis
* 1 meant no dogs or cats but caged animals are allowed.

* 2 out of 9 times "No Pets Allowed" actually means no pets allowed.
* 7 out of 9 times "No Pets Allowed" means no dogs or cats but other pets are ok.

That makes a lot of sense.

### Other than "No Pets Allowed"

The remaining 11 landlords either allowed dogs or cats or both in their posting.  Of those 11 when asked about other caged pets the response was 11 out of 11 for caged pets.

## Moral of the story

Explain your pet policy better or don't get mad when someone asks for clarification.
